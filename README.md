# Willamette Leaders - An Interactive Social Media Website For Willamette Clubs

The overall goal of this project is to increase communication, collaboration, and community within and between clubs at Willamette through providing an easy-to-use and accessible new site for club communication all in one place.

This application provides a place for Willamette clubs to make their own club pages with descriptions and info about their club and make posts about their club.
Willamette students can make accounts and follow selected clubs and ones they are a member of to see all the posts in one place in their home feed.
All users have their own profile page that is displayed to others with basic information, pronouns, and a picture.
Club presidents and advisors have inital access to their clubs, and can control who becomes members and have editing privileges from there.
Those with editing privileges can make posts and edit information about the club and its members.


After downloading this code, the database must be populated with clubs and initial users from the clubs.json file.
This can be done by running the populate_clubs command from the terminal.


This project was developed through an initial blog template from W3Schools.
Authors of this project are Jenna Hopkins and Rory Harvey.
